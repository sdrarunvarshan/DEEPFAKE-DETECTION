# DEEPFAKE-DETECTION

## 🔍 Project Overview

**Deepfake Detection Using TensorFlow\.js** is a web-based application designed to detect deepfakes in images and videos. Leveraging powerful deep learning techniques implemented with TensorFlow\.js and face-api.js, this project enables users to upload media or use real-time webcam input for identifying potentially manipulated faces.

## 🚀 Features

* 🌐 **Web-Based Interface**: No software installation required — works directly in the browser.
* 📸 **Supports Image and Video Upload**: Analyze uploaded content for deepfake indicators.
* 🎥 **Webcam Integration**: Real-time face detection and analysis.
* 🧠 **Deep Learning Powered**: Uses pre-trained models via TensorFlow\.js for on-device inference.
* 📊 **Similarity Scores & Heatmaps**: Visual feedback on facial manipulation likelihood.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript**
* **TensorFlow\.js**
* **face-api.js**
* **Chart.js** (for heatmap visualization)
* **VSCode with Live Server (Ritwick Dey extension)**

## 🧑‍💻 Getting Started
